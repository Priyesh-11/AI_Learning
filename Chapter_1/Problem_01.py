In the cathedral of night, where silence breathes through ancient constellations, I find myself dissolving into the infinite questions that dance between heartbeats. Each star above holds the ghost of light from civilizations that dreamed as we dream now—of meaning carved from chaos, of love that transcends the brutal mathematics of time. My hands, these temporary vessels of bone and longing, reach toward mysteries that my grandfather's grandfather once touched in his own sleepless hours, when the weight of existence pressed against his chest like a stone worn smooth by generations of worry. We are all archaeologists of our own souls, digging through layers of memory and hope, searching for that buried treasure of understanding that glimmers just beyond our grasp—the answer to why we ache so beautifully, why we persist in loving what we know we'll lose, why we build cathedrals and write poems in defiance of our own disappearing.
